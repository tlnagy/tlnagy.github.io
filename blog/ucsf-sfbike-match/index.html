    <article class="post-content">
        <p>Cycling is a great way to commute to work and to stay healthy. It is associated with reduced risk for cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all cause mortality <span class="citation" data-cites="Celis-Morales2017">(Celis-Morales et al. 2017)</span>. UCSF already recognizes this and <a href="http://campuslifeservices.ucsf.edu/transportation/services/biking">promotes biking</a> as a transportation mode. Citywide, bikes make up about <a href="https://www.sfmta.com/blog/san-francisco%E2%80%99s-surge-biking-continues">4.4% of all commute trips</a> (as of 2014).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the cycling infrastructure in San Francisco still needs a lot of work to be a viable option for students and staff. Too many people are <a href="http://sfgov.org/scorecards/traffic-fatalities">injured or killed</a> each year on our streets. We only have <a href="https://www.sfmta.com/blog/san-francisco%E2%80%99s-surge-biking-continues">13 miles of protected bike lanes</a> and a single protected intersection in the entire city. Researchers in Montreal have found that such infrastructure is used 2.5x times more often than the unprotected bike lanes common in San Francisco <span class="citation" data-cites="Lusk2011">(Lusk et al. 2011)</span>. Thus, in order to grow the cycling mode-share among UCSF employees, university officials should also focus on advocating in City Hall to get better infrastructure built. As the second biggest employer within the city limits, UCSF’s desires carry a lot of weight and pushing for better, safer infrastructure would benefit the health of the city’s population.</p>
<p>It is especially pressing now that we have our first Ford GoBike station at Mission Bay and we’re slated to get three more in 2018, plus the first one at Parnassus soon after. It would be a mistake to not ramp up advocacy at the same time to ensure that students and staff feel comfortable and safe while using bike share around our campuses.</p>
<p>There is already a group dedicated to promoting cycling as a transportation mode within San Francisco, the San Francisco Bike Coalition. They <a href="http://www.sfbike.org/our-work/">advocate</a> for better infrastructure and help train people in urban biking. They have a great presence at City Hall. UCSF already offers a small <a href="http://campuslifeservices.ucsf.edu/transportation/services/biking">discount</a> to join the SF Bike Coalition. I believe UCSF should go further and offer to match student and staff donations to SF Bike. A $35 donation plus a $35 match would go further than than a discount on the $35 membership.</p>
<p>Our tagline is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>UCSF: Advancing Health Worldwide</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Matching employee donations would help advance health here in San Francisco among UCSF’s own personnel by making bike commuting more attractive and more common.</p>
